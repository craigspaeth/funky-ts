# funky-ts

A WIP lightweight full-stack typescript framework that combines bun, solid, tele*fun*c, and *ky*sley (SQL Lite using Turso.tech) into a MVVMC architecture.

The entire framework is packaged as a library. You can use bunx to generate a scaffold project or simply import into an existing project—no assumptions about directory structure, web framework, etc.—works with low level APIs.
